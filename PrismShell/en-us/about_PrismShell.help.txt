SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Interact with your Beam Prism 3D printer

LONG DESCRIPTION
	This little module helps you interacting with your Prism printer.

	To get started, try to list the files and profiles:

	Get-PrismFile -ComputerName 192.168.2.11
	Get-PrismStatus -ComputerName 192.168.2.11
	Get-PrismProfile -ComputerName 192.168.2.11

	To start a new print, use Start-PrismPrint

	Start-PrismPrint -ComputerName 192.168.2.11 -Name (Get-PrismFile -ComputerName 192.168.2.11 | Where Name -eq 'Pig3.cws' ).Name -Index 1

	Tired of typing your printer IP? You can use Auto-Discovery:

	Enable-PrismAutodiscovery

	If that doesn't float your boat, simply add it as a default:

	Set-PrismDefaultPrinter -ComputerName YourPrinterDnsOrIp -MacAddress aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

	Pro-Tip: Ping your printer once, and try auto-discovery. We are using the ARP table.
